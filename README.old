1. GENERAL INFORMATION

The iPinYou global RTB(Real-Time Bidding) bidding algorithm competition is organized by iPinYou from April 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2013. 
The competition has been divided into three seasons. For each season, a training dataset is released to the participants, the testing dataset 
is reserved  by iPinYou. The complete testing dataset is randomly divided into two parts: one part is the leaderboard testing dataset to score 
and rank the participating teams on the leaderboard, and the other part is reserved for the final offline evaluation. The participant's last 
offline submission is evaluated by the reserved testing dataset to get a team's offline final score.  
We now release all the training datasets and leaderboard testing datasets.  The reverved testing datasets are still withheld by iPinYou. 
If you have special purpose using them, please contact us through dsp-competition@ipinyou.com.

2.  DATA DESCRIPTION AND FILE LIST

The files in the dataset are plain text, *.txt.bz2 or *.tar.bz2 files. With bunzip2 and tar Linux or Mac command, they can be uncompressed easily into plain text:  
           bunzip2 *.txt.bz2
           tar xvjf *.tar.bz2
The iPinYou bidding algorithm competition training dataset inlcudes a set of processed iPinYou DSP bidding, impression, click, and conversion logs. 
We have run five advertiser campaigns to get these logs generally with a fixed relatively high price bidding strategy  (with exceptions on some campaigns 
in the third season), which is for the purpose of getting enough impressions and their paying prices and which is different from that of our live working algorithms.  
The log format of the training data for the first season :  http://contest.ipinyou.com/v1/data.shtml. 
The log format of the training data for the second and third season :  http://contest.ipinyou.com/data.shtml
The main difference between the first and second/third season is the second and third season data contains the user tags column while the first season data does not. 
The log file contains tab separated values. Since the User-Agent may contain blank, commas or '#' inside, to read these files in R correctly, 
sep parameter of R has to be specified as '\t',and interpretation of comments has to be turned off by setting comment.char=''.
The testing data is formatted in the following way:
          ImpLogColumns(¡­) RelateClicks(C) IfHasConv(V)
One impression may be related 0, 1 or more clicks (C >= 0), Multiple conversions will be counted only once , so V can only be 0 or 1.
The testing data are generally collected after the training data (for the first and second season data), but not always so. The testing dataset for the third season
is generated from the normal training data.  

The complete dataset includes the following files:

3. DSP BIDDING OPTIMIZATION TASK

The participating teams optimize the following task.
      
   Maximize the number of clicks + N * the number of conversions, 
   Subject to the fixed ad budget.

In order to get clicks and/or conversions, the DSP bidding server has to first bid on ad exchange to get ad impression first. The DSP bidding server pays ad exchange as long as the ad of the advertiser whom the DSP bid for shows up on the publisher website, i.e. pay by impression. However, one ad impression does not guarantee a click by the user. The user clicks the ad only when (s)he is interested in the ad. Actually it¡¯s common to see 0.01% ~ 0.2% CTR (Clickthrough Rate) in display advertising. By the same logic, one ad click does not guarantee a conversion by the user.

Usually the DSP has a fixed ad budget for each advertiser campaign. The goal of the advertising campaign is to get as many clicks and/or conversions as possible subject to the budget constraints. The scoring function is

Score = the number of clicks + N * the number of conversions

Where N is a number between 1~100. N shows the relative importance of conversion vs. click. Each milestone may have different N value. 
For the first season,  N = 20
For the second season, N is different for different advertisers. For advertiserID=3358, N=2; for advertiserID=3476, N=10.
For the third season, N = 1. The conversion for the third season is actually reach log  

4. ALGORITHM EVALUATION AND SUBMISSION

The iPinYou bidding competition is an ONLINE algorithm competition. Here ONLINE does not mean we have both offline and online evaluation stage, but that during the offline evaluation stage, we try to imitate the online bidding process as much as possible. It means that the bidding request comes one by one, when each bidding request comes, the algorithm has to decide whether to bid, and the bidding price if it decides to bid.It also means that it makes a difference whether or not the total test data is seen beforehand, even when the click or conversion labels are withheld. For this reason, during the competition, the testing dataset is always withheld by iPinYou to do offline evaluation to make the offline evaluation as similar with online evaluation as possible. 

From the second season on, we support offline evaluation submission in Java, Python or R language.
Other constraints in running the algorithm are:

* Memory usage can NOT go beyond 512M
* Method getBidPrice() running time limit is 5ms
